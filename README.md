# AGE-GENDER-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT
This project demonstrates age and gender detection from images using OpenCV and pre-trained deep learning models. It includes facial detection, age group classification, and gender prediction, providing a practical implementation for computer vision tasks.

Features
Detects faces in images.
Classifies age into one of eight categories.
Identifies gender as Male or Female.
Interactive and user-friendly implementation in Jupyter Notebook.
Tools and Technologies
Jupyter Notebook
OpenCV for computer vision tasks.
Pre-trained Caffe models for age and gender prediction.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Libraries: OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

Navigate to the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd age-gender-classification
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the Age_Gender_Classification.ipynb file in the Jupyter interface.
Update the image path in the notebook to test with your images.
Run the notebook cells to perform face detection and age-gender classification.
Results
The output displays the detected faces in the image annotated with predicted age and gender.
Sample Image
You can include a sample output screenshot or describe the expected visual result
